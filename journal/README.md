# Journal – How We Use It

This folder is for your private thoughts, feelings, challenges, and reflections. It should feel like a safe place to unload your mind and notice patterns over time.

## Suggested Structure

- One file per day or per focused session, for example:
  - `2025-12-11.md`
  - `2025-12-11--focus-struggles.md`
- The assistant can:
  - Start a new entry for you.
  - Help you turn a messy brain‑dump into a clearer summary.
  - Reflect back patterns or themes you care about.

## Lightweight Template (Optional)

You can ignore this when it feels like too much. It’s just here when structure helps:

```markdown
# YYYY-MM-DD – Title (optional)

## What’s on my mind

...

## Feelings / body

...

## Tiny next steps

- [ ] ...
```

We can adjust this structure any time. The only hard rule is: this space is for you, and it doesn’t need to be polished.
