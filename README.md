# Babak’s Castle – Repo Overview

This repository is your private “castle”: an organized, calm place to keep your systems, kits, rules, and reflections so you feel safer and more secure over time.

Everything here is **private by default**. Nothing in this repo is meant to be public unless you explicitly decide to publish it elsewhere.

For a narrative “start here” guide, see `START-HERE.md`.

## Core Index

- **Profile & Agreements**
  - `meta/profile.md` – who you are and stable context (age, location, work, family, lifestyle, neurotype notes).
  - `meta/working-agreements.md` – how you and the assistant work together, with privacy and “private by default” rules.

- **Sessions / Handover**
  - `meta/sessions/` – short notes per working session with the assistant.
    - `meta/sessions/2025-12-11--initial-setup.md` – initial castle setup and open threads.

- **Journal**
  - `journal/` – personal journal entries (feelings, thoughts, challenges, wins).
    - `journal/README.md` – how the journal is structured and an optional template.

- **Kits**
  - `kits/` – practical “kits” that bundle tools, checklists, and mental models.
    - `kits/physical-outdoors-hunting-firearms-archery.md` – firearms & archery manifest for northern Ontario (you and Anna’s hunting setup).

- **Playbooks**
  - `playbooks/` – step‑by‑step guides for recurring situations (e.g., bad focus days, pre‑hunt routines, safety and recovery plans).  
    - *(Currently empty; we’ll add playbooks as we design them.)*

## How This Index Will Evolve

- When we create **new core docs** (kits, playbooks, rules, major reference files), we’ll add them here.
- We won’t list every journal entry individually, but we’ll keep categories and key “anchor” docs easy to find.
- If this structure ever feels off, we can reorganize and simplify; this README is meant to stay in sync with how you actually use the castle.
