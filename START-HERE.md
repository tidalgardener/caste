# Babak’s Castle – Start Here

This repository is your private “castle”: a calm place to organize your life, systems, kits, and reflections so you feel safer and more secure over time.

Everything here is **private by default**. Nothing in this repo is meant for public publishing unless you explicitly decide to use it that way.

## Principles

- Private, gentle, and low‑pressure: this is for you, not for performance.
- Simple beats perfect: small steps, low friction, easy to maintain.
- Externalize your mind: let documents carry the details so your brain can rest.
- Evolve slowly: we can rename, reorganize, and refine as we learn what works.

## Structure

- `meta/profile.md` – who you are and stable context for the assistant.
- `meta/working-agreements.md` – rules for how we work together and handle privacy.
- `meta/sessions/` – short handover notes between sessions with the assistant.
- `journal/` – personal journal entries (feelings, thoughts, challenges, wins).
- `kits/` – practical “kits”:
  - `kits/physical-outdoors-hunting-firearms-archery.md` – firearms & archery manifest for northern Ontario.
- `playbooks/` – step‑by‑step guides for recurring situations (e.g., “bad focus day”).

We can adjust this structure any time if it stops feeling natural.

## How to Use This Repo

- When you start a session with the assistant:
  - Glance at this file.
  - Check the latest note in `meta/sessions/` (if any).
- When you finish a session:
  - Capture a short handover note in `meta/sessions/` (or ask the assistant to do it).
- When you have thoughts/feelings to unload:
  - Add a new entry in `journal/` (or ask the assistant to start one for you).
- When you design a new system or area:
  - Put persistent tools/ideas into a `kit` or `playbook` rather than leaving them only in your head.

Over time, this “castle” should become a map of how you function best, what keeps you safe, and what helps you recover when things get rough.
