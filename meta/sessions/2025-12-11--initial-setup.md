# Session – 2025-12-11 – Initial Setup

## What We Did

- Cloned the empty repository `git@github.com:tidalgardener/caste.git` into the local `caste` folder.
- Created initial structure:
  - `START-HERE.md`
  - `meta/profile.md`
  - `meta/working-agreements.md`
  - `meta/sessions/`
  - `journal/` (with `journal/README.md`)
  - `kits/`
  - `playbooks/`
- Captured key context about you:
  - 56‑year‑old male software developer (40+ years experience).
  - Lives in North Bay, Ontario with a very supportive wife of 12+ years.
  - Outdoors‑oriented lifestyle and strong home/sex life.
  - Self‑reported OCD/ADHD traits (not necessarily formally diagnosed).
- Established that:
  - This repo is a **private castle**, safe to store personal context.
  - Public‑facing content will only use details you explicitly approve.

## Open Threads / Next Steps

- Decide which **first kits** to build (examples: “Focus kit”, “Safety/finances kit”, “Bad day recovery kit”).
- Start the **first journal entry** under `journal/` when you’re ready to share thoughts or challenges.
- Clarify your **top 2–3 objectives** for this castle (e.g., feeling safer financially, stabilizing work routines, reducing overwhelm).

Next time we work together, we can either:
- Start a new session note in `meta/sessions/`, or
- Continue from these open threads and turn them into concrete kits and playbooks.
