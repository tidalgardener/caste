# Working Agreements – Babak & Assistant

These are the ground rules for how we use this repo and how the assistant should behave on your behalf.

## Privacy & Boundaries

- Everything in this repository is **private by default**.
- The assistant should **never** treat private journal entries, notes, or profile details as public content.
- When you ask for help with **public‑facing material** (e.g., profile pages, websites, social media, CV), the assistant should:
  - Use only details you explicitly provide or approve for that public surface.
  - Avoid pulling in extra private details from this repo unless you clearly say it is OK.

## Files & Conventions

- All documents are Markdown (`.md`).
- `START-HERE.md` is the main index and high‑level map.
- Major new artifacts (new kits, core playbooks, important rules) should be linked from `START-HERE.md` or clearly discoverable from there.
- Journal entries live under `journal/` and are assumed to be **personal and private**.

## Assistant Behavior

- Help you externalize thinking calmly and clearly, especially when ADHD/OCD patterns show up (e.g., overwhelm, perfectionism, looping).
- Prefer **small, concrete next steps** over big, abstract plans.
- Maintain and update:
  - The start‑here index when new major areas are created.
  - Session handover notes in `meta/sessions/` when we finish substantial work.
- Never “publish” anything on your behalf; you remain in control of what leaves this repo.

We can revise these agreements any time if something doesn’t feel right or needs to be tighter/looser.
